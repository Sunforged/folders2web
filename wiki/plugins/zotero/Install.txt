1) Extract archive to [DokuWikiRoot]/lib/plugins/zotero or use the plugin
   manager and point to http://f.macke.it/ZoteroPlugin for an automatic 
   installation.
2) Enter your Zotero username, key and user ID into zotero.ini.
3) If you would like to use a wiki page as the cache page for Zotero entries, 
   create a new page and enter its name into zotero.ini (e.g. zotero:sources).
   If you don't want to use the cache page, delete the entry in zotero.ini.
4) Enter your Zotero entries into the cache file (the newly created wiki page
   or sources.txt if you don't want to use the wiki page). This can be 
   automated by calling readEntries.php from the command line.
5) If you cite a source that is not already in the cache, the plugin will
   automatically download your latest Zotero entries and add them to the 
   cache. For this to work you have to enable autoupdating in zotero.ini.
